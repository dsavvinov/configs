1. Apply `colour-consistency-patch.patch` to $HOME$/.scm_breeze directory (should be a .git-repo, at least that's how it used to be)
   It will make colouring more consistent and intuitive (yellow for unstaged changed, green for staged, bright green for new, etc.)

2. Make something equivalent to `mv git.scmbrc $HOME$/.git.scmbrc`
   It will use aliases that I like more
